Effective analysis of time series data
#General description of the code:

*  Import Libraries: First, required libraries such as Pandas for working with data, NumPy for scientific calculations and Matplotlib for visualization are imported.

*  Load Data: Data is loaded from a CSV file using pd.read_csv.

*  Data Exploration: A step is dedicated to data analysis. df.info() displays brief details of the data.

*  Data Visualization: Data is visualized using df.plot. These images are displayed in different columns such as 'ftse', 'spx', and 'nikkei'.

*  Data Preprocessing: In this step, the dates are converted to datetime format and then the 'date' column is set as the index.

*  Resampling: Data is changed to different frequencies using resample. For example, they change to daily, yearly and monthly frequency.

*  Handling Missing Data: Empty values in the data are filled using fillna, rolling, and interpolate respectively.

*  Probability Plot: A probability plot is drawn to examine the distribution of data.

Through these steps, the defined code helps to analyze and clean financial market and time series data to extract and visualize important information from the data.
